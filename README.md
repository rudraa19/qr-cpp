# qr-cpp

A tiny C++ implementation of a **QR Code generator** built completely from scratch.  
It encodes short messages into a QR code, displays it directly in your terminal, and can also export an SVG file.

## Why?

This project was built as a **learning exercise** to understand QR code structure, error correction, and rendering.
In practice, you would use a library, but building one from scratch is a fun way to dive deep into how QR codes really work.

## Project Structure

```

qr-cpp/
├─ include/
│  └─ qr.h          # Qr class (declarations)
├─ src/
│  ├─ qr.cpp        # Qr class (definitions)
│  └─ main.cpp      # CLI entry point
├─ build/           # Generated by CMake
├─ .gitignore       # Ignore build/ folder
├─ CMakeLists.txt   # Build configuration
└─ README.md        # You are here

```

---

## Build & Run

```bash
# From project root:
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./qr_cpp
````

You’ll be prompted for a **message (max 52 characters)**:

```
Enter your message: Hello QR!
```

The QR code is printed directly in your terminal, and an SVG file (`qr.svg`) is generated in the current directory.

---

## Features

* **Byte mode encoding** of messages up to 52 characters
* **Fixed QR size** (29×29 modules, version 3)
* **Error correction** with Reed–Solomon codes
* **Terminal rendering** using block characters
* **SVG output** for scalable image export

---

## Example

When you enter the message `"Hi!"`, the terminal output will look like this:

```
Enter your message: Hi!
<UNICODE-based QR code for terminal display>
```

Additionally, an SVG file will be generated:

```
qr.svg
```

You can open this SVG file in any web browser or image viewer to view the QR code at any scale, ensuring perfect clarity.

---

## Limitations

This project is intentionally constrained for simplicity:

* Only **Version 3 QR codes** are supported (fixed size `29×29`)
* Limited to **52 characters max**
* **Mask selection** is hardcoded
* Not a full QR code library — just a learning/demo project
